Hello Claude,

You are an expert-level developer specializing in Python, APIs, and CI/CD automation. I am working inside VS Code on a WSL2-Ubuntu environment.

**My Goal:**
I want to build an automated agent that scrapes conference deadlines from a list of websites and adds them as all-day events to my Google Calendar. The entire process should be automated to run on a schedule using GitHub Actions.

**My Technology Stack:**

* **Language:** Python 3
* **Scraping:** `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`
* **Calendar:** `google-api-python-client` (Google Calendar API)
* **Scheduler:** GitHub Actions

Please provide a complete, step-by-step guide to build this project. I would like the output to be broken down into the following files and explanations.

### Project Breakdown

**Project Structure I want to build:**

```

conference-automator/
│
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/
│       └── main.yml        \# The GitHub Actions scheduler
│
├── main\_scraper.py         \# The main script that runs on schedule
├── gcal\_setup.py           \# A one-time script to get Google API credentials
├── requirements.txt      \# Our Python dependencies
└── .gitignore            \# To ignore secret files

```

### What I Need From You

**1. The One-Time Google API Setup (`gcal_setup.py`)**

* Please provide a Python script (`gcal_setup.py`) that uses the `google-api-python-client` and `google-auth-oauthlib`.
* This script's *only* purpose is to be run *once* by me, locally in my WSL terminal.
* It should handle the OAuth 2.0 flow:
    1. Load a `credentials.json` file (which I will get from the Google Cloud Console).
    2. Prompt me to authorize it in my browser.
    3. Generate the `token.json` file.
* Please also provide brief instructions on where I get the `credentials.json` file.

**2. The Main Scraper Script (`main_scraper.py`)**

This is the main script that will be run by GitHub Actions. Please write this script with the following logic:

* It should load the `token.json` and `credentials.json` to authenticate with the Google Calendar API.
* **Scraping Logic:**
  * Please include a placeholder list of URLs, e.g., `CONFERENCE_SITES = ["https://example-conf.com/deadlines", "https://another-conf.org"]`.
  * Show a hypothetical scraping function for `https://example-conf.com/deadlines`. Let's assume the deadline is in an HTML tag like this: `<div><h3>Submission Deadline:</h3> <span>February 15, 2026</span></div>`.
  * The function should extract the event name ("Submission Deadline") and the date ("February 15, 2026").
* **Google Calendar Logic:**
  * Show a function that checks if an event with the *exact same title and date* already exists on my calendar (to avoid duplicates).
  * Show the function that creates a new **all-day event** if it doesn't exist.
* Please wrap this all in a `main()` function.

**3. The Dependency Files**

* Please provide the `requirements.txt` file with all the libraries needed.
* Please provide a standard Python `.gitignore` file, making sure it explicitly includes `token.json` and `credentials.json`.

**4. The Automation File (`.github/workflows/main.yml`)**

* Please provide the complete YAML file for a GitHub Action.
* It should be set to run on a schedule (e.g., every Monday at 9:00 AM) and also have a `workflow_dispatch` trigger so I can run it manually.
* The job should:
    1. Check out the code.
    2. Set up a Python environment.
    3. Install the dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
    4. Run the `main_scraper.py` script.

**5. The Security Workflow (Crucial!)**

Finally, please explain **exactly** how I should handle the `credentials.json` and `token.json` files for GitHub Actions.

* Explain that I should **not** commit them to Git.
* Explain how to:
    1. Copy the *contents* of my `credentials.json` file.
    2. Create a GitHub Repository Secret named `GOOGLE_CREDS`.
    3. Copy the *contents* of the `token.json` file (generated by `gcal_setup.py`).
    4. Create another GitHub Repository Secret named `GOOGLE_TOKEN`.
* Show me how to modify the `main.yml` file from Step 4 to securely *re-create* these two JSON files on the runner *before* the Python script runs (e.g., `echo "${{ secrets.GOOGLE_TOKEN }}" > token.json`).

Thank you for helping me build this!
